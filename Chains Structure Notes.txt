Note: The items under Document are not sections, they are children. Multiples
of each type can exist.

================================================================================


Definition sections don't exist.

  - Devices are unique in that they have colons in the assigned value
    and exist outside of events and functions. They can therefore be
    parsed out. (10001:1:0)
    
  - Constants are unique in that they are an assignment of an all-caps
    symbol can can therefore be parsed out. (MY_CONSTANT = 1)
    
  - Includes are a preparser directive signified by a pound sign and can
    therefore be parsed out. (#include 'amx-lib-volume')
    
  - Structures are a symbol ending in a colon at the highest level of
    indentation and can therefore be parsed out. (volume:)
    
  - Global variables are assignments existing outside events or functions
    at the highest level of indentation and can therefore be parsed out.
    (ui myVar = 1)
    
  - Functions contain the pointer symbol at the highest level of
    indentation and can therefore be parsed out. (myFunction ->)
    
  - Events contain the hash rocket symbol at the highest level of
    indentation and can therefore be parsed out. (button =>)
    
  - The DEFINE_START and DEFINE_PROGRAM labels really signify events. They
    can therefore be represented as events by their respective names, which
    can be parsed out. (start =>, mainline =>)
    If status is updated in event handlers, mainline => should be unnecessary
    in most cases.
    
  - The other labels (DEFINE_LATCHING, DEFINE_MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE, etc.)
    can be created with functions and probably shouldn't be used in the
    first place. If they are really needed for some reason, they can be
    defined in a NetLinx include file and a #include directive added in
    the Chains file.
  
Operations

  - Assignment
    Symbol followed by an equals sign followed by a value.
    
  - Constant
    An assignment with a symbol in all caps.
    
  - Variable Declaration
    Variable type in front of a symbol. Optional value.
    
  - Device Combine
    Children of an assignment.
    
  - String Replacement
  
  - Preparser Directive
    Statement starting with #.
    
  - Structure
    Symbol ending in a colon with children.
    
  - Function
    Line contains the pointer symbol (->).
    
  - Event
    Line contains the hash rocket symbol (=>).
    
  - Comments
    Line starts with: /*, (*, /^, (^, (!
    Line contains: //, //^
    
  - Ranges
    Contained in braces. [1..5]
